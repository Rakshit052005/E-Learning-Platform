**This project is a basic online learning website that I made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to look and work like popular learning platforms such as Coursera or Udemy. The goal was to create a nice-looking and easy-to-use website where students can see available courses, watch learning videos, and track how much they have completed through visual indicators and organized layouts.

When someone visits the website, they see a big title at the top that says "E-Learning Platform." Below that, there’s a section called "Available Courses" where different courses are listed, like “HTML & CSS Basics” and “JavaScript Essentials.” Each course is shown inside a styled card with a name, a short description, and a link that says "View Course." This makes it simple for users to quickly find and click on the course they want to start learning. The layout is kept very clean and user-friendly to help users feel comfortable while browsing the site.

When a course is opened, it shows a page with a video player (for learning tutorials), a list of chapters, and a progress bar. This gives a proper classroom-like experience where students can go step-by-step. Even though the website is just the front-end and not connected to a server yet, it is built in a way that adding more features later will be easy. There’s also a “Progress” page designed where students can keep track of how much of the course they have finished. This helps keep them motivated, organized, and focused on completing what they start.

The best part is, the website is responsive, which means it works well on all devices like laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. Whether you’re using a big screen or a small one, the content adjusts itself so it still looks neat and easy to read. I used special layout tools in CSS like Flexbox and media queries to make that happen smoothly.

The website has multiple pages—so when you click on items like "Courses" or "Progress" in the top menu, it takes you to those sections without any confusion. I made sure everything looks the same across all pages, using the same fonts, colors, and spacing. This creates a consistent design that feels clean, modern, and professional.

In this project, I focused on writing neat and organized code. HTML was used for building the page structure, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for small tasks like switching between pages, showing the progress bar, and handling simple interactions. I kept everything modular so I can easily add more cool features later.

In the future, this website can be upgraded by connecting it to a real database, adding user login/signup, saving video progress, quizzes, certificates, and more. But for now, this project clearly shows that I can create a well-designed, useful, and interactive learning website using the core web development skills I have learned.**
